In the previous chapters you have learned that biomass is suitable as a raw material for various energy conversion paths and can therefore make an important contribution towards the renewable energy system. At the same time, biogenic residues, by-products and waste are to be used as completely and efficiently as possible in the targeted circular economy. It is therefore not surprising that different studies are considering the question what quantities of biogenic resources are available for energy use today and in the future. The differences between these studies are sometimes very significant (cf. Creutzig et al. 2015). This is partly due to the fact that so far there is no standardised method for the calculation of biomass potentials and that therefore deviations due to the non-uniform use of term allocations, conversion factors, data sources, restrictions, etc. exist.

In the field of biogenic residues and waste materials, the metastudy "Biomass potentials of residual and waste materials (BIOPOT)" (Brosowski et al. 2015) produced a consistent database for Germany that provides information on the potential and current use of 93 individual biomass masses. The results of the study show that about 60-80% of the technical biomass potential is currently being used. The largest unused technical biomass potentials can be found in the area of wood and forestry residues and agricultural by-products (cf. figure below). At the same time, additional potentials can be tapped by optimising existing utilisation paths (e.g. cascading utilisation).
